# CRITICAL SECURITY & UI FIXES REQUIRED

## IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

### 1. Color System Violations (CRITICAL)
- 254 instances of hardcoded colors found across 39 files
- Must replace ALL hardcoded colors with semantic tokens
- Affects security through inconsistent theming vulnerabilities

### 2. Error Boundary Security
- Currently uses hardcoded red/blue colors
- Must use semantic tokens for proper theme compliance

### 3. Bill Payment Forms
- All 7 bill forms use hardcoded colors (bg-green-500, text-white, etc.)
- Security risk through design system bypass

### 4. Notification System
- Uses hardcoded bg-red-500 for badges
- Must use semantic destructive colors

### 5. Dashboard Components
- QuickPay icons use hardcoded color mapping
- Stats cards use hardcoded bg-green-500

## FILES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION:
1. src/components/bills/*.tsx (7 files)
2. src/components/dashboard/*.tsx (4 files) 
3. src/components/notifications/*.tsx
4. src/components/loans/*.tsx (3 files)
5. src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
6. src/components/kyc/DocumentUpload.tsx

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
1. Create color mapping utility using semantic tokens
2. Replace hardcoded colors systematically
3. Update all status indicators to use semantic colors
4. Ensure perfect light/dark mode compatibility
